# Hyperconverged Infrastructure

This document describes how to deploy EDPM nodes which
host both Ceph Storage and Nova Compute services. These types of
deployments are also known as Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI).

## Procedure Overview

1. Configure the networks of the EDPM nodes
2. Install Ceph on EDPM nodes
3. Configure OpenStack to use the collocated Ceph server

In order to complete the above procedure, the `services` list of the
`OpenStackDataPlane` CR needs to be edited.

## OpenStackDataPlane services list

EDPM nodes can be configured by creating an `OpenStackDataPlane` CRs
(or `OpenStackDataPlaneRole` and `OpenStackDataPlaneNode` CRs)
which the
[dataplane-operator](https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/dataplane-operator)
will reconcile. These types of CRs have a `services` list like the
following:

```yaml
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlane
spec:
  ...
  roles:
    edpm-compute:
      ...
      services:
        - configure-network
        - validate-network
        - install-os
        - configure-os
        - run-os
```
Only the services which are on the list will be configured.

Because we need to deploy Ceph on an EDPM node after the storage
network is configured but before Nova is configured, we edit the
services list and make other changes to the CR accordingly.

## Configure the networks of the EDPM nodes

This example assumes that the Control Plane has been deployed but
has not yet been modified to use Ceph (because the Ceph cluster does
not yet exist).

This example also assumes that the EDPM nodes:

- Have already been provisioned with an operating system (RHEL or CentOS)
- Are accessible via an SSH key that Ansible can use
- Have disks available to be used as Ceph OSDs
- Are at least three in number (Ceph clusters must have at least three
  nodes for redundancy)

Create an `OpenStackDataPlane` CR file, e.g. `dataplane_cr.yaml` to
represent the EDPM nodes. See
[dataplane_v1beta1_openstackdataplane.yaml](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/dataplane-operator/blob/main/config/samples/dataplane_v1beta1_openstackdataplane.yaml)
for an example which you will modify as described in this document.

Do not yet create the CR in OpenShift as the edits described in the
next sections will be required.

### Shorten the Service list

Shorten the services list so that it only has the services called
`configure-network` and `validate-network`.

```yaml
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlane
spec:
  ...
  roles:
    edpm-compute:
      ...
      services:
        - configure-network
        - validate-network
```
In the example above the services for `install-os`, `configure-os`,
and `run-os` have been removed. If there are other services besides
`configure-network` and `validate-network`, then remove them too but
keep track of them as the full service list will need to be restored
later.

### Disable Nova

Nova should not be configured until after Ceph has been deployed.
Ensure that the role in the CR does NOT have a `nova` key. For
example, if the above had the following, then Nova compute services
would be configured prematurely.

```yaml
  roles:
    edpm-compute:
      nova: {}
      ...
```
To prevent nova from being configured prematurely, remove the `nova` key.
```yaml
  roles:
    edpm-compute:
    ...
```

### Add a Ceph cluster network

Ceph normally uses two networks:

- `storage` - Storage traffic, the Ceph `public_network`, e.g. Glance,
  Cinder and Nova containers use this network for RBD traffic to the
  Ceph cluster.

- `storage_mgmt` - Storage management traffic (such as replication
  traffic between storage nodes), the Ceph `cluster_network`,
  e.g. Ceph OSDs use this network to replicate data.

The [Networking Documentation](networking.md) covers the `storage`
network since pods in OpenShift and containers on RHEL needs to access
the storage network. It does not cover the `storage_mgmt` network
since that network is used exclusively by Ceph.

The example
[dataplane_v1beta1_openstackdataplane_ceph.yaml](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/dataplane-operator/blob/main/config/samples/dataplane_v1beta1_openstackdataplane_ceph.yaml)
uses a storage network but not a storage management network.
Modify the CR to set
[edpm-ansible](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/edpm-ansible)
variables so that the
[edpm_network_config role](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/edpm-ansible/blob/main/roles/edpm_network_config/)
will configure a storage management network which Ceph will use as a
cluster network. For this example we'll assume that the storage
management network range is `172.20.0.0/24` and that it is on `VLAN23`.
A diff of the modified file should look similar to the following.

It is not necessary to add the storage management network to the
`networkAttachments` key.

### MTU Settings for Ceph

The example above changes the MTU of the `storage` and `storage_mgmt`
network from `1500` to `9000` (jumbo frames) for improved storage
performance (though it is not mandatory to increase the MTU). If jumbo
frames are used, then all network switch ports in the data path must
be configured to support jumbo frames and MTU changes must also be
made for pods using the storage network running on OpenShift.

To change the MTU for the OpenShift pods connecting to the dataplane
nodes, update the Node Network Configuration Policy (NNCP) for the
base interface as well as the VLAN interface. It is not necessary
to update the Network Attachment Definition (NAD) if the main NAD
interface already has the desired MTU. If the MTU of the underlying
interface is set to 9000 and it isn't specified for the VLAN interface
on top of it, then it will default to the value from the underlying
interface. See the
[CNI macvlan plugin documentation](https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/main/macvlan).
For information on the NNCP and NAP see the
[networking documentation](networking.md).

If the MTU values are not consistent then problems may manifest on the
application layer that could cause the Ceph cluster to not reach
quorum or not support authentication using the CephX protocol. If the
MTU is changed, and these types of problems are observed, then
verify that all hosts using the network using jumbo frames can
communicate at the desired MTU with a command like `ping -M do -s 8972
172.20.0.100`.

### Apply the CR

Apply the CR. For example:

`oc apply -f dataplane_cr.yaml`

When the CR is created Ansible will configure and validate the
networks, including the storage networks.

### Confirm the Network is configured

Before proceeding to the next section confirm this section has been
completed by doing the following.

- SSH into an EDPM node
- Use the `ip a` command to display the configured networks
- Confirm that the storage networks are in the list of configured networks

## Install Ceph on EDPM nodes

Use [cephadm](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephadm/index.html)
to install Ceph on the EDPM nodes. The `cephadm` package will need
to be installed on at least one EDPM node first.
[edpm-ansible](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/edpm-ansible)
does not install Ceph. Have `cephadm` use the storage
network and tune Ceph for HCI as described in the next sections.
Resume use of the OpenStack tools described
in this document after Ceph has been installed on the EDPM nodes with
Ceph tools. The rest of this section describes Ceph configuration to
be applied will using `cephadm` including use of the storage networks
configured in the previous section and Ceph tuning for HCI.

### Configuring Ceph to use the Storage Networks

Use the storage network as described in [Networking](networking.md)
for the Ceph `public_network`. Use the storage management network
for the Ceph `cluster_network`. For example, if the storage network
is `172.18.0.0/24` and the storage management network is
`172.20.0.0/24`, then create an initial `ceph.conf` file with the
following:
```ini
[global]
public_network = 172.18.0.0/24
cluster_network = 172.20.0.0/24
```
The initial `ceph.conf` file can be passed when `cephadm bootstrap` is
run with the `--config` option.

Pass the Storage IP of the EDPM node being bootstrapped with the
`--mon-ip` option. For example, if the EDPM node where Ceph will be
bootstrapped has the Storage IP `172.18.0.100`, then it is passed like
this.
```shell
cephadm bootstrap --config ceph.conf --mon-ip 172.18.0.100 ...
```

### Tuning Ceph for collocation with Nova Services

When collocating Nova Compute and Ceph OSD services, boundaries can be
set to reduce contention for CPU and Memory between the two
services. To limit Ceph for HCI, use an the initial `ceph.conf`
file with the following.

```ini
[osd]
osd_memory_target_autotune = true
osd_numa_auto_affinity = true
[mgr]
mgr/cephadm/autotune_memory_target_ratio = 0.2
```
The
[osd_memory_target_autotune](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephadm/services/osd/#automatically-tuning-osd-memory)
is set to true so that the OSD daemons will adjust their memory
consumption based on the `osd_memory_target` config option. The
`autotune_memory_target_ratio` defaults to 0.7. So 70% of the total RAM
in the system is the starting point, from which any memory consumed by
non-autotuned Ceph daemons are subtracted, and then the remaining
memory is divided by the OSDs (assuming all OSDs have
`osd_memory_target_autotune` true). For HCI deployments the
`mgr/cephadm/autotune_memory_target_ratio` can be set to 0.2 so that
more memory is available for the Nova Compute service.

A two NUMA node system can host a latency sensitive Nova workload on
one NUMA node and a Ceph OSD workload on the other NUMA node. To
configure Ceph OSDs to use a specific NUMA node (and not the one being
used by the Nova Compute workload) use either of the following Ceph
OSD configurations.

- `osd_numa_node` sets affinity to a numa node (`-1` for none)
- `osd_numa_auto_affinity` automatically sets affinity to the NUMA
  node where storage and network match

If there are network interfaces on both NUMA nodes and the disk
controllers are on NUMA node `0`, then use a network interface on NUMA
node `0` for the storage network and host the Ceph OSD workload on NUMA
node `0`. Then host the Nova workload on NUMA node `1` and have it use
the network interfaces on NUMA node `1`. Setting
`osd_numa_auto_affinity`, to true, as in the initial `ceph.conf` file
above, should result in this configuration. Alternatively, the
`osd_numa_node` could be set directly to `0` and
`osd_numa_auto_affinity` could be unset so that it will default to
false.

When a hyperconverged cluster backfills as a result of an OSD going
offline, the backfill process can be slowed down. In exchange for a
slower recovery, the backfill activity has less of an impact on
the collocated Compute workload. Ceph has the following defaults to
control the rate of backfill activity.

```ini
osd_recovery_op_priority = 3
osd_max_backfills = 1
osd_recovery_max_active_hdd = 3
osd_recovery_max_active_ssd = 10
```

It is not necessary to pass the above in an initial `ceph.conf` as
they are the default values, but if these values need to be deployed
with different values modify an example like the above and add it to
the initial Ceph configuration file before deployment. If the values
need to be adjusted after the deployment use `ceph config set osd
<key> <value>`.

### Confirm Ceph is deployed

Before proceeding to the next section confirm this section has been
completed by doing the following.

- SSH into an EDPM node
- Use the `cephadm shell -- ceph -s` command to see status of the Ceph
  cluster

#### Confirm Ceph is tuned

Use `cephadm shell` to start a Ceph shell and confirm the tuning
values were applied. For example, to check that the NUMA and memory
target auto tuning run commands lke this:
```shell
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config dump | grep numa
    osd                                             advanced  osd_numa_auto_affinity                 true
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config dump | grep autotune
    osd                                             advanced  osd_memory_target_autotune             true
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config get mgr mgr/cephadm/autotune_memory_target_ratio
  0.200000
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]#
```

We can then confirm that a specific OSD, e.g. osd.11, inherited those
values with commands like this:

```shell
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config get osd.11 osd_memory_target
  4294967296
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config get osd.11 osd_memory_target_autotune
  true
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config get osd.11 osd_numa_auto_affinity
  true
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]#
```

To confirm that the default backfill values are set for the same
example OSD, use commands like this:

```shell
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config get osd.11 osd_recovery_op_priority
  3
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config get osd.11 osd_max_backfills
  1
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config get osd.11 osd_recovery_max_active_hdd
  3
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]# ceph config get osd.11 osd_recovery_max_active_ssd
  10
  [ceph: root@edpm-compute-0 /]#
```

## Configure OpenStack to use the collocated Ceph server

Follow the
[documentation to configure OpenStack to use Ceph](ceph.md).
Though the Ceph cluster is physically co-located on the EDPM
nodes, which will also host the compute services, it can be treated
as if it is logically external. The [documentation](ceph.md) will
cover how to configure the Control Plane and Data Plane to use
Ceph. When configuring the Data Plane there are additional steps
required when using HCI which are covered below.

### Update the Data Plane CR

One way to update DataPlane CR(s) is to use the `oc edit` command:

```
oc edit openstackdataplane.dataplane.openstack.org
```

The sections below describe modifications to be made to the Data Plane
CR in detail. After the edits described below are completed, the
operators will reconcile the new configuration.

### Add ExtraMounts

The
[documentation to configure OpenStack to use Ceph](ceph.md)
includes using [extraMounts](extra_mounts.md). If you add Nova
overrides as described below without adding `extraMounts`, then Nova
service configuration will fail because of missing a missing CephX key
and Ceph configuration file.

<!-- thus extraMounts is mentioned first in case the user stops the oc edit early -->

```yaml
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlane
spec:
  roles:
    edpm-compute:
      nodeTemplate:
        extraMounts:
        - extraVolType: Ceph
          volumes:
          - name: ceph
            secret:
              secretName: ceph-conf-files
          mounts:
          - name: ceph
            mountPath: "/etc/ceph"
            readOnly: true
```

### Restore the full services list

Locate the `services` list in the CR. This list was shortened earlier
to only configure the network before Ceph was deployed. Now that Ceph
has been deployed the full services list needs to be restored. For
example:

```yaml
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlane
spec:
  ...
  roles:
    edpm-compute:
      ...
      services:
        - configure-network
        - validate-network
        - install-os
        - configure-os
        - run-os
```
It is not necessary to remove the `configure-network` or
`validate-network` services because those Ansible jobs won't
be re-run. After the `oc edit` is complete new jobs will be
created which start with by implementing `install-os` service.
Also, the Ansible roles which implement the network configuration are
idempotent.

### Configure Nova for HCI

Now that Ceph has been deployed Nova can be configured. It should also
be tuned for collocation with Ceph Services.

The [documentation to configure OpenStack to use Ceph](ceph.md)
contains an example of using a `customServiceConfig` to configure
Nova to use Ceph. Include a directive in the same
`customServiceConfig` to set the `reserved_host_memory_mb`
to a value appropriate for your system as in the following example.

```yaml
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlane
spec:
  ...
  roles:
    edpm-compute:
    ...
        nova:
          cellName: cell1
          customServiceConfig: |
            [DEFAULT]
            reserved_host_memory_mb=75000
            [libvirt]
            images_type=rbd
            images_rbd_pool=vms
            images_rbd_ceph_conf=/etc/ceph/ceph.conf
            images_rbd_glance_store_name=default_backend
            images_rbd_glance_copy_poll_interval=15
            images_rbd_glance_copy_timeout=600
            rbd_user=openstack
            rbd_secret_uuid=$FSID
          deploy: true
          novaInstance: nova
```
The value for the `reserved_host_memory_mb` may be set so that the
Nova scheduler does not give memory to a virtual machine that a Ceph
OSD on the same server will need. The example above reserves 5 GB per
OSD for 10 OSDs per host in addition to the default reserved memory
for the hypervisor. In an IOPS-optimized cluster performance can be
improved by reserving more memory per OSD.  The 5 GB number is
provided as a starting point which can be further tuned if necessary.

The `$FSID` value above should contain the actual FSID as described
in the "Create a Ceph Secret" section of the [documentation to
configure OpenStack to use Ceph](ceph.md).
